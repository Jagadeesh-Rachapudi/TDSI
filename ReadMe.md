# Models

You can find all the model checkpoints on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/). We provide the checkpoints for the following models:

- [TDLST Generator] :
  Takes an audio signal (as a waveform) and outputs a watermark of the same size as the input, which can be added to the input to watermark it. Optionally, it can also take a secret 16-bit message to embed in the watermark.
- [TDLST Detector]
  Takes an audio signal (as a waveform) and outputs the probability that the input contains a watermark at each sample (every 1/16k second). Optionally, it may also output the secret message encoded in the watermark.

Note that the message is a method of identifiaction of the source by source tracking by using IP address (up to $2**16=65536$ possible choices).

# Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how you can use AudioSealâ€™s API to embed and detect watermarks:
